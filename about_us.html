					<h3>Brief History</h3>
							<p style="font-size:16px;">The Nanomaterial Research Laboratory (NRL) was established in October 2015 in the Department of Applied Physics,
                 Delhi Technological University, Delhi, India, by a small group of research scholars led by Dr. Nitin K. Puri to
                 pursue research on nanoscale. In early years the constraints of finance, equipments and personnel were hurdles
                 for the scholars to commence their work, but their zeal, dedication and diligence made it a success. Today,
                 five years later, NRL has established facilities for synthesis of semiconductor oxides and 2D nanomaterials
                 by chemical techniques such as hydrothermal synthesis, sol-gel method, co-precipitation method and solid state
                 method and physical techniques such as plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) and double-zone
                 chemical vapour deposition (CVD). Topics of interest include, but not limited to gas sensors, bio-sensors,
                 supercapacitors, solar cells, photodetectors and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).
							</p>
              <p style="font-size:16px;">The Nanomaterial Research Laboratory has contributed highly qualified technologists and academicians to R/D
                 institutions and various government institutions. This has been possible through research and development projects
                  in the laboratory. The hard work of the head of the laboratory is reflected in large number of projects. Through
                  these projects, not only the advancement of technology in laboratory has been achieved, but also it has helped the
                  scholars to apply the seeds of research and technology wherever possible. The research group comprises of 7 active
                  research scholars, 2 postgraduate students and 4 undergraduate students working in various fields.
                  </p>
                  <p style="font-size:16px;">Research scholar associated with the laboratory continuously and consistently work with graduate and postgraduate students (including
                  B.Tech, M.Tech and M.Sc) to guide them in the field of material science and advanced experimental techniques to alter
                  the properties of nanomaterials at nanoscale. The research group of the NRL operates and maintains facilities such as
                   Chemiresistive gas sensing set-up, Potentiostat-Galvanostat Autlab, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR),
                   Electrometer, Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), Plasma Electrophoretic Deposition machine, Spin-Coating unit, various
                   muffle furnaces and hot air ovens, Vacuum oven and Tubular furnace, all under one roof. If you have any exciting and
                   fascinating idea, come and visit us. We welcome academic and laboratory collaborations. There is another laboratory
                   associated with NRL which is Advanced Sensor Laboratory (ASL) where Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD)
                   is established.
